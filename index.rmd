# What is a package?

- the fundamental unit of shareable code

```{r eval = FALSE}
# You install them like this:
install.packages("x")

# You load them like this:
library("x")

# ... and you can get help on them by using
package?x
# or
help("x")
```

---
# There are lots of ways to share code

  - email it to your collaborators

--

  - put it on a github repo and go nuts

--

  - ...other ways?
 
---
# ...so why packages?

--

- sharing reasons: easy for others to download, use, and learn about

--

- non-sharing reasons!

--

  - to organize your code
  
--

  - to make robust code that is less likely to break (yay!)

# How do I do it?


---
# The most basic developer toolbox

**Setup**: 

`{usethis}` automates setup and other repetitive dev tasks

`{roxygen2}` writes documentation and formats it the way you need `r emo::ji("kiss")`


**Testing and checking**

`{testthat}` performs tests

`{goodpractice}` automates checks for style AND content (e.g., outputs from `R CMD check`)
